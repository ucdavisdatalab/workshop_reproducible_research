Preliminaries
=============

This workshop covers the basics of using the Unix command line interface. It is
a **hybrid workshop**. First, independently work through sections 1-3 of this
online reader at your own pace. Next, join us for the live interactive session
(details below), during which we will learn to interact with the files and file
structures of our computers in new ways.

Interactive Session Information

The workshop is in-person only. There is a [recording of a previous session of this workshop on Aggie Video](https://video.ucdavis.edu/media/Introduction%20to%20the%20Unix%20Command%20Line%20â€“%202022-10-06/1_s2usj40j)

About this Reader
-----------------

This reader provides background information that will help participants to
better understand the concepts introduced during the interactive session. It
also includes information to help you successfully install software for the
workshop, **which must be completed prior to the interactive session** (note:
software setup is only necessary for Windows users).

Objectives for this Workshop
----------------------------

By the end of the workshop, learners should be able to:

+ Explain the directory structure of their computers
+ Navigate across and within files and directories
+ Create, copy, move, and delete files
+ Use command line tools to edit files
+ Identify where to go for help and to learn more

Prerequisites

No prior coding experience is required for this workshop. Participants should
have a computer with a Unix shell scripting program (Terminal, Bash, etc.)
installed and the latest version of Zoom. Windows users will need to install a
Unix terminal ahead of the session. Instructions for doing so are on the
