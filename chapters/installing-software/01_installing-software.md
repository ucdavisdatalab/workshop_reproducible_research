# Installing Software

:::{admonition} Learning Goals
:class: note
After this lesson, you should be able to:

* Explain what computing environments are
* Explain what virtual environments are and why they're useful
* List popular tools for installing software on POSIX computers
* Create and organize project directories for projects
* Initialize projects with Pixi
* Install software with Pixi
:::

This chapter will show you how to set up a computer so that it has the software
you need. You'll learn how to install software whether or not you have
administrator access.


## What's an Environment?

A **computing environment** is a collection of hardware, software, and
associated settings. Whenever you run software (including code) on your
computer, it runs in a computing environment. Being able to set up, inspect,
maintain, and document computing environments is important because:

* A computer might not have the software you need pre-installed. Often the best
  and sometimes the only solution is to install the software yourself. Doing it
  yourself gives you more control over what's installed and is typically faster
  than asking an administrator to do it for you. For your personal computer,
  you're probably the sole administrator. You can use the same tools to set up
  and maintain environments on your computer as you do on remote computers.

* Different projects may require different computing environments, and you may
  need to switch between them frequently. Switching software environments and
  settings can be quick and painless with the right tools. With modern compute
  clusters and cloud computing services, even switching hardware environments
  can be relatively easy.

* Specifying a required software environment, with versions, can make it easier
  to collaborate on, distribute, revisit, and reproduce research projects.
  Differences in environment can cause major errors or subtle bugs.

* Inspecting the computing environment is the first step to diagnosing most
  computing problems. If you ask someone for help, they'll likely want to know
  which hardware, software, and settings you're using.

In a high-level programming language like R or Python, details of the hardware
are mostly hidden away. That is, hardware has limited influence on how you
write code (with exceptions for a few specific use cases, such as GPU
computing). Hardware affects how quickly your code runs, but usually not the
final result. For many research computing projects, hardware is less of a
concern than software, so this chapter focuses on software environments.

<!--
Chapter 4 addresses ways to choose the hardware environment on compute clusters
and cloud computing services.

---

One of the major advantages of Python over other programming languages is the
massive number of packages developed and published by members the community. As
Python and Python packages are updated, code designed for older versions may
need to be edited to continue to work correctly with the newer versions. So for
most Python projects, keeping track of the software environment means keeping
track of the specific versions of Python and Python packages for which the code
was designed.
-->


## Environment Managers

A **package manager** is a tool that can download, install, update, and remove
software packages. If you've used R or Python, you might already be familiar
with the package managers they provide. Many modern operating systems also
provide a package manager, because package managers have several benefits. They
can:

* Automatically select packages compatible with the computing environment
* Automatically install dependencies for packages
* Update installed packages, often automatically or with a single command
* In some cases, provide guarantees that packages are not malicious

:::{note}
Most Linux distributions provide a package manager as the recommended way to
install software. Nevertheless, it's possible to install software on Linux
without a package manager. One way is to download the source code for the
software and compile it yourself; another is to download a pre-built binary.
[FlatPak][] and [AppImage][] are two popular formats for distributing pre-built
binaries.

Install software via a package manager when possible, but be aware that there
are alternatives when it's not.

[FlatPak]: https://flatpak.org/
[AppImage]: https://appimage.org/
:::

Some, but not all, package managers can create **virtual environments**:
self-contained environments that can coexist alongside others, even if they
contain conflicting packages. You can think of a virtual environment as being
like a terrarium for a collection of packages.

Virtual environments make it easier to work on projects with different software
requirements simultaneously. For example, suppose one of your projects requires
Python 3.13 or newer, but another uses a package that hasn't been updated since
Python 3.9. You can work on either project as needed if you create two virtual
environments and switch between them: one with Python 3.13 and one with Python
3.9.

In the strictest sense, an **environment manager** is a tool that can create,
modify, and delete virtual environments. There are environment managers that
are not package managers (and vice-versa), but from here on we'll use the terms
somewhat interchangeably.

[Pixi][pixi] is the environment manager we recommend and use. Pixi is related
to the popular environment manager [Conda][]: both install conda packages from
[conda-forge][], a community-led repository of packages for research computing.
There are packages on conda-forge for R and Python, as well as other
programming languages and tools. Pixi can also install packages from other
sources and repositories (most notably, from the [Python Package Index][pypi]).

[pixi]: https://pixi.sh/latest/
[Conda]: https://conda.org/
[conda-forge]: https://conda-forge.org/
[pypi]: https://pypi.org/

We recommend Pixi over Conda because Pixi creates environments that are fully
reproducible, takes a project-centric approach to environments, is noticeably
faster, and lacks many of Conda's quirks and pitfalls. That said, Pixi is
relatively new, so you might occasionally encounter missing features or bugs.

:::{important}
Pixi is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and generally doesn't require
administrator privileges to install.

Install Pixi by following [the official instructions][pixi].
:::

:::{note}
Examples of other popular package and environment managers are:

* [Homebrew][] for macOS and Linux
* [Chocolatey][] for Windows
* Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) for Debian-based Linux distributions
* [Nix][] for Linux and macOS
* [Spack][] for Linux and macOS, focused on high-performance computing
* [EasyBuild] for Linux, focused on research computing

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[Chocolatey]: https://chocolatey.org/
[Spack]: https://spack.io/
[Nix]: https://nixos.org/
[EasyBuild]: https://easybuild.io/
:::

:::{note}
Virtualization tools, such as [Podman][], [Docker][], and [VirtualBox][] are a
different way to create isolated computing environments. They provide complete
control over the operating system and software in an environment, so they
provide stronger guarantees of reproducibility. The cost is that these tools
are often slower than environment managers and using them requires more
technical knowledge.

For most research projects, using an environment manager provides adequate
flexibility and reproducibility.

## Pixi

Pixi manages virtual environments on a per-project basis. Each project must
have its own directory---called a **project directory**---where all of the
files related to the project are stored. We recommend organizing projects this
way even when you aren't using Pixi. By using a project directory to centralize
all of the files in a project, it's easier to:

* Find files, because you know where to look or to run search software
* Move or copy the project to other computers
* Share the project with collaborators, colleagues, or the public
* Create backup copies of the project to protect your work
* Access and run files with R, Python, and other tools
* Use version control software to manage different versions of project files

:::{tip}
Create a new project directory for every project, no matter how small. As you
produce or acquire new files for the project, make sure that they're stored in
the directory. Some examples of files you should store in a project directory
are:

* Documentation, such as a file manifest and instructions for use
* Code, such as notebooks and scripts
* Inputs, such as data sets and configuration files
* Outputs, such as reports, figures, and intermediate data sets
* License information (if the project will be shared with anyone)

Give the files descriptive names and create subdirectories to keep the files
well-organized. The gold standard is for a project directory to be completely
**portable**, meaning you can copy the directory to another computer, follow
included instructions to setup necessary software (such as R or Python), and
then run the code *without any modifications* to get the expected result.
:::

### Initializing a Project

You can initialize a project to use Pixi with the `pixi init` command. The
command takes one argument: a path to the project directory. If the directory
doesn't exist yet, Pixi will create it.

Open a terminal and make a directory where you can try out some commands:

```sh
mkdir pixi_workshop
cd pixi_workshop
```

Initialize a Pixi project called `my_project`:

```sh
pixi init my_project
```

```text
âœ” Created /home/nick/pixi_workshop/my_project/pixi.toml
```

Navigate to the new `my_project/` directory and take a look at the files
inside:

```sh
cd my_project
ls -a
```

```text
.  ..  .gitattributes  .gitignore  pixi.toml
```

The `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` files are files for [Git][], a version
control system. If you're not familiar with Git, it's safe to ignore these
files, and you can skip the rest of this paragraph. The `.gitattributes` file
tells Git how to handle merges for `pixi.lock`, a file Pixi uses to keep track
of installed packages. The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the `.pixi/`
subdirectory, which is where Pixi installs packages.

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/

:::{seealso}
We recommend using Git for your research computing projects. To learn more,
check out the [Introduction to Version Control](ch-version-control-systems)
chapters.
:::

The `pixi.toml` file identifies the project as a Pixi project. It's also a
place where you can store metadata about the project (such as its name,
authors, and version) and where Pixi will store details about the project's
virtual environments.

Open `pixi.toml` in a text editor (such as `vim`). It will look something like
this:

```toml
[project]
authors = ["YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>"]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "my_project"
platforms = ["linux-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
```

The file is in [TOML][] format, a format designed to be easy for both people
and computers to read and write. TOML files consist primarily of key-value
pairs of the form `key = value`. The key-value pairs can be organized into
named tables with headers of the form `[name]`.

[TOML]: https://toml.io/en/

A `pixi.toml` file always has at least three tables:

* `project` is metadata about the project.
* `tasks` is a list of project-specific commands.
* `dependencies` is a list of required packages for the project's default
  virtual environment, which starts out empty (no packages).

When you initialize a project, Pixi fills in as much of `pixi.toml` as it can.
For instance, it gets your name and email from Git, if you have Git installed
and configured. You can edit `pixi.toml` to add or correct details.
{numref}`editing-pixi.toml` explains more about this file, but first, let's
install some packages.


### Adding & Removing Packages

You can list a project's packages with `pixi list`. Go ahead and try this for
the `my_project` project:

```sh
pixi list
```

```text
âœ˜ No packages found in 'default' environment for 'linux-64' platform.
```

We haven't installed any packages yet, so there are none to list.

Suppose we want to install Python. Package names are always lowercase and
usually not surprising, although you can use the `pixi search` command or
search online if you're not sure about a package's name. Python is in the
`python` package.

You can install a package with the `pixi add` command. So the command to
install Python is:

```sh
pixi add python
```

```text
âœ” Added python >=3.13.2,<3.14
```

By default, Pixi installs the most recent compatible version of a package. So
depending on your computer's operating system and when you run the command,
Pixi might install a different version of Python.

:::{tip}
You can use `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` with `pixi add` to set constraints on
package versions. For instance, if you want the most recent version of Python
less than 3.10:

```sh
pixi add 'python<3.10'
```

When you set constraints like this, make sure to surround them with single
quotes (`' '`) or the shell will misunderstand the command.
:::

:::{caution}
The `pixi add` command installs packages. Don't confuse it with the `pixi
install` command, which installs entire virtual environments. You usually won't
need to run `pixi install`, because Pixi runs it automatically as needed.
:::


The `python` package is now listed in the environment, along with all of its
dependencies:

```sh
pixi list
```

```text

```

Packages you installed explicitly are printed in bold (although the bold
doesn't show up in this reader). All of the other packages are dependencies.
You can use `pixi add` multiple times to install whatever packages you need.

Once you've installed some packages in a virtual environment, you'll probably
want to use them. You can run a command in the virtual environment with the
`pixi run` command. So to run `python`:

```sh
pixi run python
```

This will open a Python prompt in the virtual environment. You can use Python
as you would normally at this point.

:::{note}
On most operating systems, you can use `which` to check which program a command
will run. For instance, try:

```sh
pixi run which python
```

Compare the output to:

```sh
which python
```
The output should be different. The `which` command is a Unix shell tool, not
part of Pixi.
:::

If you no longer need a package for your project, you can uninstall it with
`pixi remove`. Let's remove Python from our project:

```sh
pixi remove python
```

```text
âœ” Removed python
```

The environment is once again empty:

```sh
pixi list
```
```text
âœ˜ No packages found in 'default' environment for 'linux-64' platform.
```

With Python uninstalled, let's install another major language of data science:
R. The package for R is called `r`. We'll also install R's popular ggplot2
package for data visualization. In conda-forge, R packages have the prefix
`r-`, so ggplot2 is `r-ggplot2`. We can install both packages in a single `pixi
add` command:

```sh
pixi add r r-ggplot2
```

When you need to run multiple commands in a virtual environment, typing `pixi
run` in front of each one is inconvenient and tedious. Instead, you can use
`pixi shell` to launch a subshell in the virtual environment. Any commands you
enter in the subshell run in the virtual environment.

:::{caution}
If you're using Windows and Git Bash, the `pixi shell` command is [not yet
supported][pixi-shell-win].

[pixi-shell-win]: https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/417
:::

Open a subshell:

```sh
pixi shell
```

Now try running `R`. You can use R normally, exit, and reopen R again without
leaving the virtual environment. When you're finished with the subshell, enter
`exit` to return to your original shell.


(editing-pixi.toml)=
### Editing `pixi.toml`

When you install a package with `pixi add`, Pixi adds the package's name and a
version constraint to the `pixi.toml` file. Likewise, when you uninstall a
package with `pixi remove`, Pixi removes the package's name from the file. The
file is a description of the project and the virtual environment(s) it
requires.

Open `pixi.toml` in a text editor again:

```toml
[project]
authors = ["YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>"]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "my_project"
platforms = ["linux-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
r = ">=4.4,<4.5"
r-ggplot2 = ">=3.5.1,<4"
```

The packages we installed in the default virtual environment with `pixi add`
are listed in the `dependencies` table, along with their version constraints.
In the constraints, the lower bound comes from the version of the package that
was actually installed. The upper bound is one minor version higher. We say
these packages are **pinned** because there are specific constraints on their
versions. Pixi makes sure constraints on pinned packages are satisfied unless
you explicitly override them.

In addition to or instead of using `pixi add` and `pixi remove` to manage
packages, you can do so by editing `pixi.toml` directly. For instance, if you
want to remove a package, just remove its line from `pixi.toml`. Pixi will
automatically uninstall the package the next time you run a `pixi` command.
Similarly, you can add packages by adding a line to `pixi.toml`, and they'll be
installed the next time you run a command.

Take a look at the files in the `my_project/` directory again now that we've
added and removed some packages:

```sh
ls -a
```

```
.  ..  .gitattributes  .gitignore  .pixi  pixi.lock  pixi.toml
```

There's a new directory called `.pixi/`. This is where Pixi installs all of a
project's virtual environments and packages.

:::{tip}
If you know you won't work on a project again for a while (or ever), you can
safely delete `.pixi/` to get back some storage space. All of the information
needed to reconstruct the virtual environment(s) is in `pixi.toml` and
`pixi.lock`.
:::

There's also a new file `pixi.lock`, called a **lockfile**. The lockfile lists
the exact version and source of every package, including dependencies,
installed in the project's virtual environments. It's a complete specification,
in contrast to the flexible specification in `pixi.toml`. Both are useful: the
lockfile is for reproducing environments exactly, while the `pixi.toml` file is
for producing compatible environments---as defined by the version
constraints---that might differ slightly from the originals.

:::{important}
If you use Git, make sure to commit both `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock`.
:::

By default, Pixi will only compute the lockfile for your computer's operating
system. If you plan to use other operating systems---or share your project with
people who do---it's a good idea to have Pixi compute the lockfile for all of
them. You can do this by adding the operating systems to the `platforms` key in
`pixi.toml`. Some valid operating systems are `linux-64`, `macos-64`,
`osx-arm64` (for M1, M2, ...), and `win-64`. Computing the lockfile for all of
the operating systems where your project might be used can help you catch
problems with virtual environments early, such as packages that are not
available for some operating systems. For example, if you want to include all
three operating systems, change the `platforms` key to:

```toml
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
```

Pixi searches for and installs packages from the conda-forge repository by
default. In the jargon of Pixi (and Conda), package repositories are called
**channels**. You can specify other channels Pixi should search for packages in
`pixi.toml`'s `channels` key. The channels have highest to lowest priority from
left to right.

#### Tasks

In addition to being a package and environment manager, Pixi is also a simple
**task runner**: a tool that can run other commands in a convenient way. Tasks
make the functionality or workflow of your project easier for other people to
discover---especially when paired with detailed documentation---and lower the
cognitive burden on you and your collaborators to remember the syntax for
specific commands.

You can create tasks with the `pixi task` command or by editing the `[tasks]`
table in `pixi.toml`. In `pixi.toml`, tasks take this form:

```toml
task_name = { cmd = "commands_to_run", description = "Help for the task." }
```

The `description` field is optional and can be omitted, but it's a good habit
to document your tasks.

As an example, we use these tasks in the project for this reader:

```toml
[tasks]
build = { cmd = "jupyter-book build .", description = "Build the reader." }
publish = { cmd = "ghp-import --no-jekyll --no-history --push _build/html", description = "Publish the reader to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub." }
clean = { cmd = "rm -rf _build/", description = "Remove the build directory." }
rebuild = { depends-on = ["clean", "build"], description = "Remove the build directory and build the reader." }
```

The `build` task generates the reader from source files, the `publish` task
uploads the reader to the web, and the `clean` task deletes the built reader
(in case we want to rebuild it). The `rebuild` task is special: instead of a
command to run, it specifies that it `depends-on` the `clean` and `build`
tasks. So Pixi will run both of those tasks when you run `rebuild`.

You can run tasks with the `pixi run` command and the name of the task. So in
the project for this reader, we can run the `build` task with this command:

```sh
pixi run build
```

:::{caution}
Be careful not to give tasks names that conflict with other tools you use. For
instance, `python` is probably not a good name for a task.
:::


:::{seealso}
There are many other useful things you can do by editing `pixi.toml`, such as
setting up multiple virtual environments or specifying minimum hardware
requirements for a project.

See [the Pixi documentation][pixi] for more details.
:::


### Global Installs

Occasionally, you might come across a tool that's broadly useful but not
required by any particular project. For example, ripgrep (`rg`) is a tool to
search for files that contain a given text string (or regular expression). It's
a faster, modernized version of the classic `grep` tool, and worth knowing
about if you use the command line frequently, because it can help you find
files quickly. 

You can use the `pixi global install` command to install a package globally, so
that it's available in all shells without any need to use `pixi run` or `pixi
shell`. Try installing `ripgrep` this way:

```sh
pixi global install ripgrep
```

```text
Global environments as specified in '/home/nick/.pixi/manifests/pixi-global.toml'
â””â”€â”€ ripgrep: 14.1.1 (installed)
    â””â”€ exposes: rg
```

Pixi creates a new virtual environment for each package you install this way,
in order to prevent conflicts. You can use `pixi global list` to see which
packages you've installed globally:

```sh
pixi global list
```

```text
Global environments as specified in '/home/nick/.pixi/manifests/pixi-global.toml'
â””â”€â”€ ripgrep: 14.1.1
    â””â”€ exposes: rg
```

If you want to uninstall a globally-installed package, use `pixi global
uninstall`. For example, to uninstall `ripgrep`:

```sh
pixi global uninstall ripgrep
```

```text
âœ” Removed environment ripgrep.
```
