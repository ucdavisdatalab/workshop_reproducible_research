Assessment: Introduction to the Unix Command Line
=================================================

To earn a micro-badge for this workshop, follow the prompts on the next page.
You will do all of your work on the command line, after which you will export
your command history and submit it to GradPathways.

For questions marked "Short answer", record your notes directly in the files
you've created. Submit these files in addition to your command history.

1. Working code: were you able to complete each prompt successfully?
2. Understanding your actions: can you explain what your actions do and why you
   implemented them?

Prompts
-------

1. Unzip `command_line_assignment.zip` and put it in your Home directory. You
   can do so on the command line or with your computer's windowing system. Once
   you've put the directory in Home, navigate to it via the command line.

2. Clear your shell history with the following:

    + If you are using Bash, use:

        ```{bash, eval=F}
        $ history -c
        ```

    + If you are using Zsh, use:

        ```{bash, eval=F}
        $  history -p
        ```

    + If you don't know what shell you're using, run the following command,
      which will display your current shell:

        ```{bash, eval=F}
        $ echo $0
        ```
  
3. From the top level of `command_line_assignment`, navigate to the lowest
   subdirectory. Move `1.txt` up to the top of the directory.

4. Navigate to `level_2a` and remove `extra_file.txt`. Then, copy the other
   file, `2.txt`, to the top of the directory.

5. Navigate up one subdirectory from `level_2a` and rename `wrong_name.txt` to
   `3.txt`. Move `3.txt` to the top level of `command_line_assignment`.

6. Navigate to `level_2b`. Make note of the name of the dotfile in this folder.

7. Return to the top level of `command_line_assignment`. Using Vim, create and
   open a new file titled `4.txt`. Enter `Insert` mode and press
   `Return/Enter`. On a second line, type the following (do not include
   quotations): “::::FINISHED!::::”.

8. Skip two lines in Vim. Write the name of the dotfile in `level_2b`. Then,
   skip another two lines. In a few sentences, explain the difference between a
   relative and absolute path. Given an example of each. When you are finished,
   save `4.txt` and exit the file.

9. There should now be four `.txt` files in the top level of
   `command_line_assignment`. Use a command to list the _directory_ content and
   make sure. Then, with a different command, print the _file_ content of each
   of these files to your terminal window.

    + You can use `*.txt` to apply a command to all text files in a folder 
  
10. Send the output of the file contents to a new file titled `complete.txt`.
   You can do so with the following:

    ```{bash, eval=F}
    $ [command] *.txt > complete.txt
    ```
    
    Be sure to check your work. Open `complete.txt` with Vim. If you do not see
    your answers from above in this file, you will need to try this step again.

11. Export your command line history with:

    ```{bash, eval=F}
    $ `history > command_line_history.txt`
    ```

12. Submit `complete.txt` and `command_line_history.txt` to the GradPathways
   portal.
